Programming Historian Creating New Items in Zotero Notes

Learn how to create a new item in a Zotero library and add basic metadata like title and date. Helpful to remember that Zotero began as a citation management system and that an item on Zotero contains only metadata, like a library calling card. To upload file content into Zotero, you would create an attachment to that item. 

Get into python interpreter, type "python"
Import the need python modules. Type "from libZotero import zotero"
Got >>>
Type "import urllib2"
Got >>>
Type "import datetime"
Got >>>
This will connect the zotero group library for this lesson using the group ID and API key. Could replace with own. Copy and paste "zlib = zotero.Library('group', '155975','<null>', 'f4Bfk3OTYb7bukNwfcKXKNLG')"
Got >>>
Can now creat a new item and assign it some metadata. Make it a document file and give it a title. Copy and Paste "newItem = zotero.getTemplateItem('document')"
Got >>>
Copy and Paste "newItem.set('title', 'Python Lesson Document')"
Got >>>
Add an abstract note (short description). Set creation date as current date. Copy and Paste "newItem.set('abstractNote', 'Created using a zotero python library and the write api')"
Got >>>
Copy and Paste "now = datetime.datetime.today().strftime("%Y-%m-%d")"
Got >>>
Copy and Paste "newItem.set('date', now)"
Got >>>
Make a request to the API to create that item. Code includes the writeFailure property so we get an error if it doesn't work. Copy and Paste "createdItem = zlib.createItem(newItem)"
Got >>>
Copy and Paste "if createdItem.writeFailure != False:"
Got ...
Add 4 spaces and copy and paste "print(createdItem.writeFailure['code'])"
Got ... 
Add 4 spaces and copy and paste "print(createdItem.writeFailure['message'])" and hit Enter twice
Got >>>
Add a tag to new item. Includes a writeFailure. Copy and Paste "tagname = 'python lesson'"
Got >>>
Copy and Paste "createdItem.addTag(tagname, '0')"
Got >>>
Copy and Paste "updatedItem = zlib.writeUpdatedItem(createdItem)"
Got >>>
Copy and Paste "if updatedItem.writeFailure != False:"
Got ... 
Add 4 spaces and Copy and Paste "print("Error updating item")"
Got ...
Add 4 spaces and Copy and Paste "print(updatedItem.writeFailure['code'])"
Got ...
Add 4 spaces and Copy and Paste "print(updatedItem.writeFailure['message'])" Hit enter twice
Got >>>
This code confirms the item that you created. Copy and Paste "print 'Created new item <%s> with new tag <%s>' % (createdItem.title, tagname)"
This is what output you should get. Got "created new item <Python Lesson Document> with the new tag <python lesson>

Looked for it, but the item didn't actually get created.
